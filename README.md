It should be possible for the user to browse the list of characters. Users of the app should be
able to toggle a character as a favorite and these selections should be persisted across restarts
of the app. Favorite characters should appear at the top of the list when the list is loaded. The
details screen should show the character’s occupation and status obtained from the API
endpoint.
The code can be written in the language of your choice and you are free to use open source
libraries as you see fit. We would like to see a bug-free app, with a clean UI, that is written with
a modern architecture. Please write tests where they are appropriate. The app should be
compatible with Android 6.0 or above (API Level 23+).
